# Meta-IR-Framework

**Meta-IR** (Meta-Learning for Imbalanced Regression) is a framework for **meta-learning-based recommendation** of models and strategies in *imbalanced regression* problems.

It automates the process of:
- Extracting **meta-features** from regression datasets,
- Training **meta-models** that learn from prior experiments,
- Generating **recommendations** (model + balancing strategy),
- Executing and **evaluating** those recommendations using relevance-based metrics.
